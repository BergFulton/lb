This TODO should not exist, since Lame Blog should not exist in the first 
place.  Anyways, here it is:

* Individual entries link to all.html, which is one directory above.

* Probably use the template system used in monologue

* Use an XmlSerializer to load config data, instead of being hardcoded
  to use by miguel only
