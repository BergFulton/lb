This is Lame Blog.

	A small script that I wrote to maintain my blog on the web.  I
	did not use another blog system, because I had different
	requirements than other people have.

	I wanted:

		* To support off-line editing.  Since for long periods
	  	  of time I might not have an internet connection.

		* To be able to edit my blog entries with my choice
		  editor, not using some integrated tool.

		* To keep my old .txt file format for my entries.

		* To do some minimal processing on the input.

	To configure LameBlog, you must create a file config.xml, which
	looks like this:

		<?xml version="1.0"?>
		<config
		    Author="Miguel de Icaza (miguel@gnome.org)"
		    BlogDirectory="/home/miguel/activity"
		    BlogFileName="index.html"
		    BlogWebDirectory="http://tirania.org/blog/"
		    BlogImageBasedir="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel"
		    Copyright="Miguel de Icaza"
		    Description="Miguel de Icaza's web log"
		    ManagingEditor="miguel@gnome.org"
		    Title="Miguel de Icaza"
		    RSSFileName="miguel"
		    InputEncoding="utf-8"
		    OutputEncoding="utf-8"
		    AnalyticsStub="analytics"
		/>

	The various parameters should be self explanatory.
		
	It looks for blog entries in:

		~/activity/YYYY/mmm-dd{-N}.{html|txt}

	Ie, for example:

		~/activity/2003/oct-01.html

	To add multiple entries per day, append a -N to the entry:

		~/activity/2003/oct-01-1.html
		~/activity/2003/oct-01-2.html

	For historic reasons, it generates an all.html (compatibility
	with old permalinks) and also now it generates per-day
	permalink entries in the archive/ directory.

	To run, you must type:

		make

	To upload, edit the settings on the Makefile, and type:

		make push

	The result is then pushed to a server with rsync.

Enjoy,
