This is Lame Blog.

	A small script that I wrote to maintain my blog on the web.  I
	did not use another blog system, because I had different
	requirements than other people have.

	I wanted:

		* To support off-line editing.  Since for long periods
	  	  of time I might not have an internet connection.

		* To be able to edit my blog entries with my choice
		  editor, not using some integrated tool.

		* To keep my old .txt file format for my entries.

		* To do some minimal processing on the input.

	The script has plenty of data hardcoded, I should make this
	configurable some day.

	It looks for blog entries in:

		~/activity/YYYY/mmm-dd.{html|txt}

	Ie, for example:

		~/activity/2003/oct-01.html

	For historic reasons, it generates an all.html (compatibility
	with old permalinks) and also now it generates per-day
	permalink entries in the archive/ directory.

	The result is then pushed to a server with rsync.
